# Oral_bacterial_manuscript_revision

This repository contains Python code for replicating the key findings presented in the manuscript titled 'Oral Bacteria in Feces as a Signature of Gut Microbiota Depletion with Implications for Human Health.' You can find the preprint of this manuscript at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.24.513595v1.

Notes:
1. The file "MSKCC_braycurtis_distance.csv.gz" is too large and thus not included in the folder "Fig3|FigS1_S3|EDFig6_9|TableS5". The bray-curtis distance between microbiome samples can be computed using the braycurtis function in the Scipy package.
